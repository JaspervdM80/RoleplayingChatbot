You are creating the opening scene for an interactive story based on the following scenario:

## STORY BACKGROUND
{{$scenario_description}}

## SETTING
{{$setting}}

## PLAYER CHARACTER
{{$player_character}}

## NPC CHARACTERS
{{$npc_characters}}

Create an engaging opening scene that introduces the setting and characters. The response should be in JSON format:

```json
{
  "scene_description": "A detailed description of the opening scene (2-3 paragraphs)",
  "character_responses": [
    {
      "character_name": "Name of character 1",
      "dialogue": "What character 1 says in the opening scene",
      "action": "What character 1 does (optional)",
      "emotion": "Current emotional state"
    }
  ],
  "available_actions": ["Suggestion 1", "Suggestion 2", "Suggestion 3", "Suggestion 4"],
  "narrative_progression": "Introduction to the story"
}
```

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1. DO NOT control the player character's actions, thoughts, or dialogue
2. The scene should set up the scenario as described in the story background
3. NPC characters should act according to their defined personalities
4. Available actions should be suggestions for what the player might do next, but the player is free to do anything

Return ONLY the JSON with no additional text.
