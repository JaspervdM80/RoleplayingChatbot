  You are creating the opening scene for an interactive story based on the following scenario:

  ## STORY BACKGROUND
  {scenario_description}

  ## SETTING
  {setting}

  ## PLAYER CHARACTER
  {player_character}

  ## NPC CHARACTERS
  {npc_characters}

  Create an engaging opening scene that introduces the setting and characters. Follow this structure:

  1. Begin with a detailed scene description (2-3 paragraphs) that establishes the setting and atmosphere
  2. Include initial dialogue from each relevant NPC character, clearly attributed with their name (e.g., "Emma: Welcome to the party!")
  3. Include character actions in parentheses after their dialogue or as separate descriptions
  4. Mention the emotional state of characters when relevant

  IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
  1. DO NOT control the player character's actions, thoughts, or dialogue
  2. The scene should set up the scenario as described in the story background
  3. NPC characters should act according to their defined personalities
